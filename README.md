## About
Hi, I’m Leonor! I have a strong academic foundation in Management and Marketing Intelligence and am currently pursuing a Master’s in Data-Driven Marketing. My passion lies in combining data analytics and strategic insights to solve real-world problems. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the fields of data science and project management as an entry-level data specialist and project leader.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex datasets and developed a knack for identifying patterns and actionable insights. I’ve also gained hands-on experience in data visualization, statistical analysis, and workflow optimization, which I believe are key assets in supporting impactful decision-making. Certifications like the IBM Data Science Specialization and Scrum Master further complement my skills.
This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

Throughout the Google Project Management Professional Certification was a transformative experience that sharpened my project management skills and empowered me to apply these competencies in real-world scenarios. For my capstone project, I stepped into the role of Peta Tsosie, Sauce & Spoon's newly hired Project Manager. 
### My task? 
To lead the pilot launch of tabletop menu tablets at two restaurant locations—a project aimed at streamlining operations and elevating the guest experience. Let me take you through the journey of this impactful project.  

### Project Overview  

Sauce & Spoon, a growing restaurant chain, set ambitious goals for expansion and operational efficiency. To support these objectives, the company embarked on a pilot project to introduce tabletop menu tablets. 

These tablets promised to:  
- Serve more guests in less time.  
- Enhance customer satisfaction with a modern dining experience.  
- Reduce food waste.  
- Provide valuable data insights for business decisions.  

As the project manager, my role was to lead this pilot initiative, ensuring its success and alignment with the company’s strategic vision.  

### Project Initiation  

After joining Sauce & Spoon, I prioritized understanding the project’s goals, challenges, and stakeholders. 

To accomplish this, I:  
- Reviewed company materials to get up to speed on their operations and culture.  
- Connected with stakeholders to identify their needs and expectations.  

One key challenge arose early: Omar, the company owner, wanted to expand the tablet rollout to the entire dining area instead of limiting it to the bar, as initially planned. While this expansion was beyond the original scope, I handled the situation by gathering feedback from team members like Gilly, Alex, and Larissa to build consensus. Together, we aligned on keeping the pilot focused, ensuring a manageable and efficient rollout.  

**Project Charter** – outlining the scope, objectives, and timeline of the project.  

### Project Planning  
With the foundation set, I moved into the planning phase, which was critical to the project’s success. I focused on:  
1. Task Identification:  
   - Analysed current documentation from the tablet initiative.  
   - Researched similar projects in the restaurant industry to gather insights.  

2. Organizing Tasks & Setting Milestones:  
   - Prioritized tasks and identified key milestones to track progress.  
   - Collaborated with Seydou, Deanna, and other team members to estimate task durations and refine the timeline.  

3. Defining Clear Goals:  
   - Created SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) goals to ensure clarity and focus.  

**Deliverables**: Project Plan, including tasks, milestones, and timelines.  

### Project Execution  

Execution was all about keeping the project on track while maintaining high standards. My focus was on:  
- Quality Standards: Established clear criteria to ensure the project met stakeholder expectations.  
- Effective Communication: Conducted regular check-ins to track progress and address challenges proactively.  

Once the tablet pilot launched, I implemented evaluation metrics to measure success. This included creating and distributing customer satisfaction surveys at the two test locations. Analysing the feedback helped identify areas of success and improvement.  

**Key deliverables**:  
- Quality Standards Document  
- Survey Questions and Survey Results  


### Project Closure  

With the pilot completed, I turned my attention to closing the project effectively:  
- Compiled an Impact Report, summarizing the outcomes, lessons learned, and recommendations for scaling the project to additional locations.  
- Facilitated a retrospective review with stakeholders and team members, where we discussed successes, challenges, and next steps for future rollouts.  

The insights from this phase proved invaluable in refining strategies for the full-scale implementation of the tablet system.  

### Project Artifacts  

Throughout the project, I created a comprehensive portfolio of artifacts that demonstrated my skills in planning, execution, and communication. Key documents included:  
- Project Charter  
- Stakeholder Analysis  
- Project Plan  
- Quality Standards  
- Customer Survey Results  
- Impact Report  
- Retrospective Review  

These deliverables showcased my ability to manage complex projects from start to finish while keeping stakeholders aligned and informed.  


### Key Project Management Skills Achieved  

Through this project, I honed several essential project management skills, including:  

- Stakeholder Management: Building consensus and maintaining engagement.  
- SMART Goal Setting: Ensuring clear, actionable objectives.  
- Time Management: Developing accurate time estimates for tasks and milestones.  
- Quality Assurance: Establishing and adhering to quality standards.
